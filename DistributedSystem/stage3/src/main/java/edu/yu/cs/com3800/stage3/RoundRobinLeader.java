/*
Round Robin Task Assignment, Asynchronous Results
The leader/master assigns tasks to the workers on a round-robin basis.
What we mean by round-robin is simple: when a client request comes in,
the master will simply assign the client request to the next worker in the list of workers.
When the master gets to the end of the list of workers,
it goes back to the beginning of the list and proceeds the same exact way.
You should think of the list of workers as a circularly linked list which the master is looping through forever â€“
the master assigns a request to the current worker and then advances to the next worker in the list.
The master thread MUST NOT synchronously wait (a.k.a. block) for a worker to complete a task;
all work in the cluster is done asynchronously (otherwise, we would gain nothing by having multiple servers.)
The master sends work to a worker via a UDP message and receives results via a UDP message;
there is no synchronous connection or blocking.
Implication of Moving Work Around The Cluster: Request IDs
Each client request has to be assigned a request ID by the master so that as requests / results are passed between master and worker we have a way of knowing what request a given message is relevant to.
